# NoclipUtils
Unofficial collection of random utility scripts to use on the console of [noclip.website](https://noclip.website/).

## Disclaimers
- None of these are guaranteed to remain working and can break at anytime due to changes to the main website without warning.
- These scripts are all unofficial (with few exceptions that will be explicitly stated) and are not officially endorsed by Jasper (developer of noclip.website).
- None of those scripts are meant for ripping or downloading of assets from noclip.website as this is against the website's policies (with good reason).
- Some basic knowledge on how to use JS and the browser console is expected to use these.

## Usage
To use these scripts, you can either manually copy and paste them directly on the console everytime you want to use them, or you can put them on a JavaScript injection extension for whichever browser you use and have them be injected automatically. (You will still need to open the console to actually run the scripts you want by calling their functions)
